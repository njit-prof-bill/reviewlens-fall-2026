# ReviewLens AI - Sprint 1 Stories (Fall 2026)

This is the Sprint 1 backlog for the ReviewLens AI capstone project.

Story writing format for Jira:

- Story ID
- Title
- Outcome — what must be true when complete
- Technical Guidance — implementation boundaries and expectations
- Rules — applicable canonical business rules

Sprint 1 focus: Engineering baseline, managed authentication, per-user security, analysis targets, and review ingestion.

Total stories: 23

Stories S1-001 through S1-008 establish the team engineering baseline and are primarily team-level setup work.

Stories S1-009 through S1-023 define the primary application capabilities for Sprint 1. These 15 feature stories are sized so that a five-person team can generally assign approximately three primary feature stories to each developer.

## How To Read This Sprint Document

1. This file is the authoritative source for Sprint 1 scope.
2. `README.md` provides the overall product description, but Sprint 1 grading is based on this file.
3. Features described in the overall product but not listed here are not required for Sprint 1.
4. Technical Guidance defines important implementation expectations but intentionally does not prescribe a specific application architecture, programming language, framework, database, or cloud platform unless explicitly stated.
5. Teams should make reasonable engineering decisions where implementation details are unspecified.
6. Features planned for later sprints should not be implemented early unless explicitly approved.

## Sprint 1 Demonstration Goal

The Sprint 1 application should demonstrate the following end-to-end workflow:

1. A user authenticates.
2. The user creates an analysis target.
3. The user submits a valid review source.
4. Review data is ingested and persisted.
5. The persisted reviews remain associated with the correct analysis target and authenticated user.
6. A second authenticated user cannot access the first user's targets or review data.

The team should demonstrate the workflow as a coherent application experience rather than presenting each Jira story independently.

---

# CI/CD and Testing Requirements (Required)

These requirements apply to all Sprint 1 stories.

## CI/CD Baseline Gate

1. Every pull request must automatically run:
   - lint or equivalent static checks
   - application build
   - automated unit tests
2. A pull request with any required failing check cannot be merged through the team's normal protected-branch workflow.
3. CI output must be visible to reviewers before merge.
4. Required checks must run from repository configuration rather than relying on a developer to execute them manually.
5. Application secrets, credentials, and API keys must not be committed to source control.

## Test Baseline Expectations

1. Every feature story must include at least one automated test update.
2. Tests should verify observable behavior rather than implementation details whenever practical.
3. Authentication and authorization stories must include negative-path tests.
4. Validation stories must test both accepted and rejected input.
5. Persistence stories must verify that created data can be retrieved from the persistence layer.
6. Ownership tests must demonstrate that cross-user access is denied.
7. Ingestion parsing or normalization should be tested using deterministic sample data or fixtures.
8. CI tests should not depend on the continued availability or exact content of a live third-party review website.
9. External dependencies should be mocked, stubbed, recorded, or otherwise isolated in automated tests where practical.

## Minimum Test Evidence by Story Type

### User-Facing Behavior

1. Happy-path behavior.
2. At least one non-happy-path behavior.

### Validation

1. Valid input succeeds.
2. Invalid input fails with an appropriate application response.

### Persistence

1. Data is created or updated.
2. Persisted data can be retrieved.
3. Ownership relationships are preserved.

### Authentication and Authorization

1. Authorized request succeeds.
2. Unauthenticated request is denied where authentication is required.
3. Cross-user request is denied where ownership applies.

### Ingestion

1. Representative valid input is processed.
2. Malformed or unsupported input is handled safely.
3. Expected review fields are normalized correctly.
4. Failure does not silently create fabricated review data.

## Definition of Done Additions

A Sprint 1 story is not complete until:

1. The story outcome works in the running application.
2. Required automated tests pass locally.
3. Required automated tests pass in CI.
4. The story does not knowingly break previously completed behavior.
5. The pull request contains a short `Test Evidence` section describing the tests used to verify the story.
6. Significant technical assumptions or limitations are documented where another developer would reasonably need to know about them.

# Canonical Business Rules (Sprint 1)

These rules are authoritative for Sprint 1 implementation and grading.

## S1-BR Authentication and Identity

1. **S1-BR-001**: Authentication must use a managed identity service such as Clerk, Supabase Auth, Auth0, Firebase Authentication, Amazon Cognito, or an equivalent service approved by the instructor.
2. **S1-BR-002**: Teams are not expected to implement their own password storage or credential authentication system.
3. **S1-BR-003**: Authentication is required for all protected ReviewLens application functionality.
4. **S1-BR-004**: Protected backend requests must verify authenticated identity. Hiding frontend controls is not sufficient access protection.
5. **S1-BR-005**: The authenticated identity supplied by the identity provider must be mapped to the application's user-owned data.
6. **S1-BR-006**: After logout, the previous authenticated application session must no longer provide access to protected application functionality.

## S1-BR Data Ownership and Security

1. **S1-BR-007**: All user-scoped ReviewLens records must be associated with an authenticated owner.
2. **S1-BR-008**: Cross-user reads, writes, updates, and ingestion operations must be denied.
3. **S1-BR-009**: Ownership authorization must be enforced on the backend or persistence security layer. Frontend filtering is not sufficient.
4. **S1-BR-010**: A client-supplied user ID or owner ID must not by itself be trusted as proof of ownership.
5. **S1-BR-011**: Application secrets, provider credentials, database credentials, and review-service credentials must not be exposed in source control or browser-delivered code unless the credential is explicitly designed by the provider to be public.

## S1-BR Analysis Targets

1. **S1-BR-012**: Each team supports one public review platform for the capstone.
2. **S1-BR-013**: Every AnalysisTarget belongs to exactly one authenticated user.
3. **S1-BR-014**: An AnalysisTarget must identify:
   - the entity being analyzed
   - the team's supported review platform
   - the source URL or equivalent source reference required for ingestion
4. **S1-BR-015**: Required target information must be validated before the target is accepted.
5. **S1-BR-016**: A user may view and open only AnalysisTargets owned by that user.
6. **S1-BR-017**: AnalysisTarget data must persist across refresh and later authenticated sessions.

## S1-BR Review Ingestion

1. **S1-BR-018**: Review ingestion must operate only against an AnalysisTarget owned by the authenticated user.
2. **S1-BR-019**: The application may collect reviews from a target URL or allow review data to be supplied through a practical supported import mechanism.
3. **S1-BR-020**: At minimum, each successfully ingested Review must contain:
   - review text
   - rating
4. **S1-BR-021**: Source identifiers, reviewer names, dates, URLs, or other metadata should be preserved when they are available and useful, but they are not universally required unless specified by the selected review platform.
5. **S1-BR-022**: Ingested reviews must be associated with the correct AnalysisTarget.
6. **S1-BR-023**: Each ingestion attempt must have a recorded result state sufficient to distinguish success from failure.
7. **S1-BR-024**: The application must not fabricate review records to make a failed or incomplete ingestion appear successful.
8. **S1-BR-025**: Invalid or unusable ingestion input must produce a meaningful application error.
9. **S1-BR-026**: A detailed ingestion analytics summary is not required in Sprint 1. Sprint 1 requires only enough ingestion status to determine whether the operation succeeded or failed.

## Rule Usage in Stories and Jira

1. Any Sprint 1 story may reference one or more S1-BR IDs instead of repeating the complete rule text.
2. If story behavior conflicts with a canonical business rule, the canonical business rule prevails.
3. A developer implementing a story is responsible for understanding all rules referenced by that story.

# A. AI and Engineering Context Documents

These are team-level engineering deliverables. They establish shared expectations for both human developers and AI-assisted development tools.

## S1-001 - Create Engineering Coding Standards Context Document

**Outcome:**  
The team publishes an engineering context document describing the conventions developers and AI coding tools should follow when modifying the codebase.

**Technical Guidance:**

The document should address at least:

1. Repository and folder organization.
2. Naming conventions.
3. Formatting and linting expectations.
4. Error-handling conventions.
5. API or service response conventions where applicable.
6. Logging expectations.
7. Expectations for adding dependencies.
8. Expectations for testing new or changed behavior.

The document should describe the team's actual chosen approach rather than generic software-development advice.

**Rules:** S1-BR-004, S1-BR-007, S1-BR-011

## S1-002 - Create UI/UX Standards Context Document

**Outcome:**  
The team publishes a UI/UX context document defining the visual and interaction conventions that will keep independently developed ReviewLens features coherent.

**Technical Guidance:**

The document should address at least:

1. Application navigation.
2. Page layout.
3. Form conventions.
4. Validation and error presentation.
5. Loading and processing states.
6. Button and action conventions.
7. Spacing and typography.
8. Reusable component expectations.

The standards should be specific enough that two developers implementing different pages can produce a recognizably consistent application.

**Rules:** S1-BR-003, S1-BR-015, S1-BR-025

## S1-003 - Create Data and Security Guardrails Context Document

**Outcome:**  
The team publishes a context document describing ReviewLens ownership boundaries, authentication assumptions, authorization requirements, secret handling, and prohibited data-access patterns.

**Technical Guidance:**

At minimum, the document should explain:

1. Which managed identity provider the team selected.
2. How provider identity maps to application ownership.
3. Which entities are user-scoped.
4. Where authorization is enforced.
5. Why client-supplied ownership identifiers are not trusted.
6. How secrets and environment configuration are managed.
7. How developers will test cross-user isolation.

A new developer or AI coding tool should be able to read this document and understand that every user-owned query and mutation must preserve tenant isolation.

**Rules:** S1-BR-001 through S1-BR-011

## S1-004 - Create AI-Assisted Development and Review Context Document

**Outcome:**  
The team publishes a context document describing how AI-assisted code is prompted, reviewed, tested, and approved before merge.

**Technical Guidance:**

The document should address:

1. Which AI coding tools the team expects to use.
2. What context should be supplied to those tools.
3. Expectations for reviewing generated code.
4. Expectations for validating generated dependencies or APIs.
5. Required testing before generated code is accepted.
6. How AI session transcripts are retained for the project.
7. Situations where generated code requires additional security review.

AI-generated code is treated as team-authored code and is subject to the same Definition of Done.

**Rules:** S1-BR-004, S1-BR-008, S1-BR-011

---

# B. Project and Delivery Baseline

## S1-005 - Establish Project Structure and Local Development Workflow

**Outcome:**  
The repository has a stable application structure and documented commands that allow another team member to install dependencies and run the Sprint 1 application locally.

**Technical Guidance:**

The team may choose its architecture and technology stack.

At minimum:

1. Frontend and backend responsibilities must be identifiable.
2. Persistent storage configuration must be identifiable.
3. Required installation commands must be documented.
4. The application must have a repeatable local startup process.
5. Environment-specific values must not be hard-coded into source files.

A monorepo is allowed but not required.

**Rules:** S1-BR-011

## S1-006 - Configure Code Quality and Automated Test Tooling

**Outcome:**  
The project has working lint/static-analysis, formatting, and automated unit-test tooling appropriate to the selected technology stack.

**Technical Guidance:**

1. Tool commands must be runnable by any developer from the repository.
2. Tests must run without requiring manual browser interaction.
3. At least one meaningful automated test must exist for each application layer where unit testing is appropriate.
4. Formatting rules should be consistently enforceable rather than depending on individual editor configuration.

**Rules:** Sprint 1 CI/CD and Testing Requirements

## S1-007 - Configure Pull Request Continuous Integration

**Outcome:**  
Every pull request automatically executes the team's required build, lint/static checks, and unit tests.

**Technical Guidance:**

1. CI must run from committed repository configuration.
2. Required checks must report success or failure on the pull request.
3. A deliberately failing test should cause the pipeline to fail.
4. A build failure should cause the pipeline to fail.
5. The protected development workflow must prevent normal merge when required checks are failing.

The team may use GitHub Actions or another approved CI platform.

**Rules:** Sprint 1 CI/CD Baseline Gate

## S1-008 - Configure Environment and Secret Management

**Outcome:**  
Developers can configure local application dependencies without committing secrets, and the repository documents the environment values required to run the system.

**Technical Guidance:**

1. Real secrets must not be committed.
2. A template such as `.env.example` or equivalent should document required configuration names without exposing credentials.
3. Authentication-provider credentials must follow the provider's public/private key guidance.
4. Database and third-party ingestion credentials must be server-side where required.
5. Missing required configuration should result in an understandable startup or runtime failure.

**Rules:** S1-BR-011

---

# C. Managed Authentication and User Ownership

## S1-009 - Integrate Managed Authentication

**Outcome:**  
A user can authenticate with the team's selected managed identity provider and establish an authenticated ReviewLens session.

**Technical Guidance:**

The team should use the selected provider's supported SDK or integration mechanism rather than implementing password handling itself.

The application must:

1. Recognize whether the current request or session is authenticated.
2. Make the provider's stable user identity available to protected backend operations.
3. Maintain authentication across normal page navigation and refresh according to the provider's supported session model.
4. Provide a functional logout path.

Provider-hosted or provider-supplied registration and login UI is acceptable.

Teams are not graded on recreating authentication UI that the managed service already provides.

**Rules:** S1-BR-001 through S1-BR-006

## S1-010 - Protect ReviewLens Routes and Backend Operations

**Outcome:**  
Unauthenticated users cannot access protected ReviewLens pages or protected backend operations.

**Technical Guidance:**

Protection must exist at both relevant boundaries:

1. The UI should prevent or redirect unauthenticated navigation into protected application areas.
2. The backend must independently reject protected requests that do not contain valid authenticated identity.

A developer must be able to demonstrate that directly calling a protected API without authentication does not succeed.

Expected automated tests should include at least:

1. Authenticated request succeeds.
2. Unauthenticated request fails.
3. Protected data is not returned with the failure response.

**Rules:** S1-BR-003, S1-BR-004, S1-BR-006

## S1-011 - Associate User-Owned Data with Authenticated Identity

**Outcome:**  
When an authenticated user creates a user-owned ReviewLens record, ownership is derived from the verified authenticated identity and persisted with the record.

**Technical Guidance:**

The backend must derive ownership from trusted authentication context.

For example, a request such as:

`POST /analysis-targets`

must not become owned by another user merely because the client submits a different `userId`.

The exact persistence design is the team's decision. Acceptable approaches include:

1. Provider user identifier stored as owner.
2. Internal User entity mapped to provider identity.
3. Database-level tenant identity derived from authenticated context.

Whatever approach is selected must be applied consistently to user-scoped records.

**Rules:** S1-BR-005, S1-BR-007, S1-BR-010

## S1-012 - Enforce Cross-User Analysis Target Authorization

**Outcome:**  
An authenticated user cannot read or modify an AnalysisTarget owned by another authenticated user.

**Technical Guidance:**

Authorization must be enforced even when a user knows or guesses another target's identifier.

Testing should use at least two distinct authenticated user identities:

1. User A creates or owns Target A.
2. User B attempts to retrieve Target A.
3. User B attempts a modifying operation against Target A.
4. Both unauthorized operations are denied.
5. Target A remains unchanged.

Do not rely on the fact that Target A is absent from User B's UI.

**Rules:** S1-BR-007 through S1-BR-010, S1-BR-016

## S1-013 - Enforce Cross-User Review and Ingestion Authorization

**Outcome:**  
An authenticated user cannot read, create, modify, or initiate ingestion against review data belonging to another user's AnalysisTarget.

**Technical Guidance:**

Review ownership may be inherited through the AnalysisTarget rather than duplicated on every Review record, but authorization must still be provable.

At minimum, automated tests should demonstrate that User B cannot:

1. Retrieve User A's target reviews.
2. Submit ingestion against User A's target.
3. Create review records under User A's target through a protected backend request.

The backend should validate ownership of the parent AnalysisTarget before performing child-resource operations.

**Rules:** S1-BR-007 through S1-BR-010, S1-BR-018

---

# D. Analysis Target Baseline

## S1-014 - Implement AnalysisTarget Persistence Model

**Outcome:**  
The application can persist and retrieve an AnalysisTarget with its required Sprint 1 fields and authenticated owner relationship.

**Technical Guidance:**

At minimum, an AnalysisTarget must represent:

1. Unique target identifier.
2. Authenticated owner.
3. Entity or target name.
4. Supported review platform.
5. Source URL or equivalent source reference.
6. Creation timestamp.

Teams may include additional fields when useful.

The persistence model should support later association with multiple Reviews and ingestion attempts.

Tests should verify that a persisted AnalysisTarget can be retrieved with the expected values and ownership.

**Rules:** S1-BR-012 through S1-BR-017

## S1-015 - Create an Analysis Target

**Outcome:**  
An authenticated user can create a new AnalysisTarget from the ReviewLens user interface.

**Technical Guidance:**

The application must collect enough information to satisfy the AnalysisTarget persistence model.

Because each team supports only one review platform, the platform may be:

1. Explicitly selected in the UI, or
2. Fixed by team configuration and displayed to the user.

The backend must assign ownership from authenticated identity.

After successful creation, the user should receive clear confirmation and be able to continue working with the newly created target.

Tests should verify both UI/service behavior and persistence where appropriate.

**Rules:** S1-BR-012 through S1-BR-017

## S1-016 - Validate Analysis Target Input

**Outcome:**  
The application rejects an AnalysisTarget when required target information is missing or the source information is invalid for the team's supported ingestion approach.

**Technical Guidance:**

Validation should occur at an authoritative backend boundary even if the frontend also validates input.

At minimum, test:

1. Missing target/entity name.
2. Missing source information.
3. Clearly malformed source input.
4. Valid input succeeds.

If the team accepts URLs, the validation should reject values that are not usable URLs.

If the team supports only one platform, teams may additionally validate that submitted URLs reasonably correspond to that platform.

Validation does not need to prove that ingestion will ultimately succeed; actual source accessibility belongs to the ingestion workflow.

**Rules:** S1-BR-012, S1-BR-014, S1-BR-015

## S1-017 - View My Analysis Targets

**Outcome:**  
An authenticated user can view a list of their persisted AnalysisTargets.

**Technical Guidance:**

The list should provide enough information for a user to identify and select a target.

At minimum, display:

1. Entity/target name.
2. Supported review platform.
3. Source reference or a useful representation of it.

The backend query must be constrained by authenticated ownership rather than retrieving all targets and filtering them only in the browser.

Tests should demonstrate:

1. User A sees User A targets.
2. User B sees User B targets.
3. User B does not receive User A targets.

**Rules:** S1-BR-007 through S1-BR-010, S1-BR-016

## S1-018 - Open an Analysis Target Workspace

**Outcome:**  
A user can select one of their AnalysisTargets and open a stable workspace for performing Sprint 1 ingestion operations.

**Technical Guidance:**

The workspace must clearly identify the active target.

At minimum, display:

1. Target/entity name.
2. Review platform.
3. Source reference.
4. Current basic ingestion state when one exists.
5. An available path to initiate ingestion.

The workspace establishes the context that later sprints will extend with ingestion summary and Q&A functionality.

Direct navigation to a target identifier belonging to another user must be denied by the authorization behavior defined elsewhere in this sprint.

**Rules:** S1-BR-016 through S1-BR-018

---

# E. Review Ingestion Baseline

## S1-019 - Submit Review Source for Ingestion

**Outcome:**  
An authenticated user can initiate review ingestion for an AnalysisTarget they own using the source mechanism supported by the team.

**Technical Guidance:**

The team may implement either:

1. Ingestion from a publicly accessible target URL, or
2. A practical data-import mechanism appropriate to the supported review platform.

The ingestion request must reference an existing AnalysisTarget.

Before ingestion begins, the backend must verify:

1. The request is authenticated.
2. The AnalysisTarget exists.
3. The authenticated user owns the AnalysisTarget.
4. Required source information is present.

A request against another user's target must fail before review processing occurs.

**Rules:** S1-BR-018, S1-BR-019, S1-BR-025

## S1-020 - Extract or Import Review Data

**Outcome:**  
The application can obtain representative review data from the team's supported review source and identify individual review records.

**Technical Guidance:**

At minimum, the ingestion layer must be capable of obtaining:

1. Written review text.
2. Rating.

Teams may use scraping, browser automation, a publicly available API, supplied export data, or another practical method consistent with the project requirements.

Important constraints:

1. The team must document its selected ingestion approach.
2. The application must not silently substitute hard-coded sample reviews for real ingestion.
3. Automated tests should use deterministic fixtures, saved representative input, mocks, or equivalent isolation rather than depending entirely on a live website.
4. Teams should isolate source-specific parsing sufficiently that it can be tested independently of the user interface.

**Rules:** S1-BR-019 through S1-BR-021, S1-BR-024

## S1-021 - Normalize Ingested Reviews

**Outcome:**  
Raw review-source data is transformed into the application's canonical Review representation before persistence.

**Technical Guidance:**

Every successfully normalized Review must contain:

1. Review text.
2. Rating.

Teams should also preserve useful source metadata when available, such as:

1. Source review identifier.
2. Reviewer/display name.
3. Review date.
4. Review URL.
5. Source-specific metadata useful for later analysis.

Normalization should handle malformed individual records without corrupting otherwise usable data.

Tests should include representative examples of:

1. Valid review.
2. Missing required review text.
3. Missing or invalid rating.
4. Optional metadata that is absent.

The team's handling of invalid individual records should be explicit and consistent.

**Rules:** S1-BR-020, S1-BR-021, S1-BR-024

## S1-022 - Persist Ingested Reviews with Target Ownership

**Outcome:**  
Successfully normalized Reviews are persisted and associated with the correct AnalysisTarget.

**Technical Guidance:**

The persistence model must support later retrieval of all Reviews belonging to a selected AnalysisTarget.

The system must preserve the ownership boundary transitively through the target.

At minimum, tests should verify:

1. Reviews are persisted after successful ingestion.
2. Persisted review text and rating match normalized input.
3. Reviews are associated with the intended AnalysisTarget.
4. Reviews from Target A do not appear when retrieving Target B.
5. A user cannot retrieve persisted Reviews through another user's target.

Teams should consider how duplicate source reviews could eventually be identified, but sophisticated re-ingestion and duplicate-resolution behavior is not required in Sprint 1.

**Rules:** S1-BR-007 through S1-BR-010, S1-BR-022

## S1-023 - Record and Report Ingestion Result State

**Outcome:**  
Each ingestion attempt records enough state for ReviewLens to tell the user whether the operation succeeded or failed.

**Technical Guidance:**

The application should represent an ingestion attempt separately enough that failure does not masquerade as successful persisted review data.

At minimum, the application must be able to distinguish:

1. Ingestion started or processing, if the implementation is asynchronous.
2. Ingestion succeeded.
3. Ingestion failed.

A team may additionally support a partial-success state.

For a successful operation, the application should provide at least a basic confirmation that review records were ingested.

For a failed operation:

1. The failure should be visible to the user.
2. Existing valid data should not be silently replaced with fabricated data.
3. Technical failure information should be logged appropriately.
4. User-visible errors should not expose secrets or sensitive internal details.

A detailed ingestion result summary, rating analytics, charts, and dataset analysis are Sprint 2 work.

Tests should include successful and failed ingestion outcomes.

**Rules:** S1-BR-023 through S1-BR-026

---

# Sprint 1 Demo Expectations

The team has approximately 15 minutes to demonstrate the Sprint 1 increment.

The demo should emphasize working software and engineering evidence rather than Jira administration.

A recommended demonstration flow is:

1. Show the CI pipeline and current passing quality gates.
2. Authenticate as User A.
3. Create a valid AnalysisTarget.
4. Attempt invalid target input and show validation.
5. Open the AnalysisTarget workspace.
6. Initiate review ingestion.
7. Show that real review data was persisted.
8. Show basic ingestion success state.
9. Authenticate as User B.
10. Demonstrate that User B cannot access User A's target or review data.
11. Briefly show representative automated tests supporting the demonstrated behavior.

The team does not need to demonstrate every test or every individual story.

Every team member should be prepared to explain:

1. The stories they implemented.
2. The automated tests supporting those stories.
3. How their changes passed through CI.
4. Important implementation decisions or tradeoffs.

---

# Sprint 1 Explicitly Out of Scope

The following functionality is not required for Sprint 1:

1. Detailed ingestion result analytics or visualization.
2. LLM-based review Q&A.
3. Q&A scope guard implementation.
4. Vector databases or embeddings solely for future Q&A functionality.
5. Sentiment analysis.
6. Multiple supported review platforms.
7. Persisted chat history.
8. Production deployment.
9. Automated production deployment.
10. Post-deployment smoke tests.
11. Sophisticated re-ingestion, refresh, reconciliation, or duplicate-resolution workflows.
12. Team-built password authentication or password storage.

Teams should prioritize completing, testing, and integrating the Sprint 1 requirements before implementing later-sprint functionality.
