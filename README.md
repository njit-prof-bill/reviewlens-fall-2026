# ReviewLens

ReviewLens is a reusable application template for small SaaS products.

It provides the common foundation for future apps, including layout conventions, authentication wiring, API structure, database setup, CI/CD validation, and deployment plumbing.

ReviewLens is not itself a production product. Its purpose is to validate and preserve the reusable starting point for future applications.

## Rebrand for a New App

Use `scaffold.env` as the single source of naming defaults for apps created from this template.

For a full step-by-step adoption path from fresh clone to local and AWS deployment, see `docs/setup/repository-adoption.md`.

1. Update values in `scaffold.env`:

- `APP_SLUG`
- `APP_DISPLAY_NAME`
- `API_NAME`
- optional AWS/repo naming values

2. Preview changes:

```bash
./scripts/scaffold-rebrand.sh --dry-run
```

3. Apply replacements across tracked files:

```bash
./scripts/scaffold-rebrand.sh
```

By default, all values remain set to ReviewLens so current behavior, tests, and deployments are unchanged.

**AWS OIDC Trust Setup:**

The AWS account, IAM OIDC provider, and GitHub ↔ AWS trust relationship are now established for secure, keyless deployment. See `docs/decisions/0004-iaas-refactor.md` and `docs/development-logs/9-iaas-refactor.txt` for the exact commands and process.

## Frontend UX + PWA Baseline

Recent template baseline updates include:

- Header account controls now use a user-avatar dropdown menu (Settings, Account, Sign out)
- Left sidebar now contains primary navigation only (Home)
- Mobile/tablet ergonomics improved with a larger avatar trigger touch target
- Progressive Web App (PWA) support is enabled for the web app

PWA implementation notes:

- Build plugin: vite-plugin-pwa
- Install assets: web manifest and app icons under apps/web/public/icons/
- Runtime caching is conservative for SaaS auth safety:
  - NetworkOnly for API and Clerk/auth-related traffic
  - StaleWhileRevalidate for static assets
  - NetworkFirst for non-API page navigations
- Service worker is registered in production builds

PWA validation (from apps/web):

```bash
nvm use 20.19.0
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Then verify installability and service worker behavior in browser DevTools Application tab (or Lighthouse PWA audit).

## Local Development

Run local development with three running processes:

- PostgreSQL (Docker)
- FastAPI backend (`apps/api`)
- Vite frontend (`apps/web`)

### Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop running
- Python 3.11+ installed
- Node 20.19.0 installed (`nvm use 20.19.0`)
- Clerk environment variables configured (see `docs/setup/authentication.md`)

Important auth isolation rule:

- Use separate Clerk apps per environment (`reviewlens-local` and `reviewlens-dev`).
- Do not point local and cloud dev at the same Clerk app.
- If separation was not done initially, follow reset runbook in `docs/operations/cloud-development.md`.

### First-Time Setup

1. Start database (from repo root):

```bash
./scripts/dev-db-up.sh
```

2. Set up backend environment and install dependencies:

```bash
cd apps/api
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
alembic upgrade head
```

3. Install frontend dependencies:

```bash
cd apps/web
nvm use 20.19.0
npm install
```

### Start Local Dev Environment

Open three terminals.

Terminal 1 (database, from repo root):

```bash
./scripts/dev-db-up.sh
```

Terminal 2 (backend API):

```bash
cd apps/api
source .venv/bin/activate
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Terminal 3 (frontend):

```bash
cd apps/web
nvm use 20.19.0
npm run dev
```

App URLs:

- Frontend: `http://localhost:5173`
- Backend health: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/health`

### Stop Local Dev Environment

1. Stop frontend and backend with `Ctrl+C` in their terminals.
2. Stop database from repo root:

```bash
./scripts/dev-db-down.sh
```

### Reset Local Database (Optional)

If you need a clean local DB:

```bash
./scripts/dev-db-reset.sh
cd apps/api
source .venv/bin/activate
alembic upgrade head
```

## Terraform Source Control Rules

If you work under `infra/`, commit Terraform source files and ignore Terraform runtime artifacts.

Commit these:

- `*.tf`, `*.tfvars.example`, module code, scripts, and docs
- Environment configuration templates that do not include secrets

Do not commit these:

- `.terraform/` (provider binaries and module cache)
- `*.tfstate*` (state files and backups)
- `.terraform.lock.hcl` and `*.tfplan*`
- `crash*.log`, `.terraformrc`, `terraform.rc`, `.terragrunt-cache/`

Use local `terraform.tfvars` files for environment values and secrets, and keep them out of git.

## Operator Scripts

| Script                                      | Purpose                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `scripts/aws-env.sh`                        | Sets project-scoped `AWS_PROFILE`, `AWS_REGION`, and `GITHUB_REPO` variables for use in other scripts and CLI commands |
| `scripts/cloud-status.sh <aws\|azure\|gcp>` | Checks the running state of cloud resources without needing to know any URLs                                           |
| `scripts/dev-db-up.sh`                      | Start the local PostgreSQL container                                                                                   |
| `scripts/dev-db-down.sh`                    | Stop the local PostgreSQL container                                                                                    |
| `scripts/dev-db-reset.sh`                   | Wipe and recreate the local database                                                                                   |

`cloud-status.sh` is template-portable: it derives the resource name prefix from `GITHUB_REPO` in `aws-env.sh`, so apps built from ReviewLens only need to update that one variable.

## AWS Manual Setup Notes

When running AWS manual setup for this repository, use project-scoped shell variables instead of global shell configuration:

```bash
source scripts/aws-env.sh
```

This prevents AWS profile/region leakage into unrelated projects.

Before provisioning, validate account and region explicitly:

```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
aws configure get region
```

If AWS Toolkit in VS Code shows multiple regions in Explorer, treat that as UI state. Use explicit CLI profile/region resolution as the source of truth for deployment commands.

## GitHub Actions AWS Setup

Current GitHub Actions coverage includes:

- `ci.yml`: web, API, and Terraform fmt/validate checks
- `provision-dev.yml`: manual Terraform apply for the AWS dev environment
- `deploy-dev.yml`: manual backend/frontend deployment to the provisioned AWS dev environment
- `teardown-dev.yml`: manual teardown with `pause` or `destroy` mode

Workflow editor note:

- The workflow files include an explicit YAML schema hint for GitHub Actions to reduce false-positive parser errors in the VS Code Problems panel.

Repository secret required:

- `AWS_ROLE_ARN`: IAM role trusted by GitHub OIDC

Provision workflow inputs:

- `AWS_REGION`: AWS deployment region, for example `us-east-2`
- `TF_STATE_BUCKET`: remote Terraform state bucket name created by bootstrap
- `TF_STATE_KEY`: remote Terraform state object key, for example `dev/terraform.tfstate`
- `ENVIRONMENT_NAME`: Terraform environment name, typically `dev`
- `CLERK_JWKS_URL`: Clerk JWKS URL
- `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: Clerk publishable key used by frontend builds
- `CLERK_SECRET_KEY_ARN`: Secrets Manager ARN for the Clerk secret key
- `RDS_DATABASE_URL_ARN`: Secrets Manager ARN for the database URL
- `CORS_ORIGINS`: CloudFront URL after first provision; may be blank on the first run
- `CLERK_ISSUER`: optional
- `CLERK_AUDIENCE`: optional

Provision workflow behavior notes:

- Performs a targeted early bootstrap of database/networking and ECR before full plan/apply.
- Synchronizes `RDS_DATABASE_URL_ARN` secret value from the live RDS-managed credentials and endpoint.
- Uses a psycopg-compatible connection URL with `sslmode=require` for App Runner connectivity to private RDS.
- Pushes a minimal placeholder image to ECR so first-time App Runner service creation can pull `latest`.

Deploy workflow inputs:

- `AWS_REGION`
- `TF_STATE_BUCKET`
- `TF_STATE_KEY`
- `ENVIRONMENT_NAME`
- `FORCE_BACKEND_REBUILD`: `true` or `false`

Deploy workflow behavior notes:

- Ensures `/reviewlens-dev/cors_origins` contains the current CloudFront origin before App Runner deployment.
- Treats App Runner `ROLLBACK_SUCCEEDED` as a terminal deployment failure state (fail-fast instead of timing out).

Teardown workflow inputs:

- `MODE`: `pause` or `destroy`
- `AWS_REGION`
- `TF_STATE_BUCKET`
- `TF_STATE_KEY`
- `ENVIRONMENT_NAME`
- `CONFIRM_DESTROY`: must be set to `DESTROY` for destroy mode
- `KEEP_ECR_REPOSITORY`: `true` or `false` (destroy mode only)

The deploy workflow reads the frontend publishable key from SSM Parameter Store after Terraform provisioning, so it does not require that value to be repeated manually.

Backend image behavior in deploy workflow:

- Uses immutable backend image tag format `sha-<GITHUB_SHA>` and also updates `latest`
- Checks ECR for `sha-<GITHUB_SHA>` before build
- Reuses existing SHA-tagged image when present (unless `FORCE_BACKEND_REBUILD=true`)
- Builds and pushes new image when SHA tag is missing

Important constraint:

- GitHub-hosted runners cannot directly reach the current private RDS instance, so database migrations are not part of `deploy-dev.yml` yet.

Teardown behavior summary:

- `pause` mode: pauses App Runner, stops RDS (if available), empties frontend S3 content, and invalidates CloudFront
- `destroy` mode: runs `terraform destroy` for the dev environment state
- `destroy` + `KEEP_ECR_REPOSITORY=true`: detaches ECR resources from Terraform state before destroy, so the repository remains in AWS

ECR preserve caveat:

- If ECR is preserved during destroy, a later Terraform apply may require importing the existing ECR resources back into state.

## AWS Resource Organization

This repository does not use a CloudFormation stack or AWS CDK stack to group resources.

Instead, AWS resources are organized by:

- Terraform state in `infra/providers/aws/terraform/environments/dev`
- Consistent naming with the `reviewlens-dev-*` prefix
- Shared AWS tags such as `Project=reviewlens`, `Environment=dev`, and `ManagedBy=terraform`

That means full teardown will be driven by `terraform destroy`, not by deleting a single AWS stack.

Two exceptions are outside normal Terraform teardown because they are bootstrap-managed:

- Terraform remote state bucket + DynamoDB lock table
- Secrets Manager bootstrap secrets
